# Hot reloading with opengl in odin
This code demostrates how to implement hot reloading in odin
I also got opengl functions running from the dll. 

To run the main code run build_main.bat
after you've got the main window open you can change and recompile the game code inside games folder.
Which will create game.dll in the main folder and the main window will reload the dll.
